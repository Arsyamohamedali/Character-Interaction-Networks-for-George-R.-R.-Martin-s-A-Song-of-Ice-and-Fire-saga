# Character-Interaction-Networks-for-George-R.-R.-Martin-s-A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire-saga

This repo contains code for the following ones:

1.Visualizing the data as a graph (in-built function).

2.Identifying the most important character. Importance is defined based on the degree of the node.

3.Finding out the shortest path between the characters Addam-Marbrand and Ysilla. The shortest path is used to identify the closeness of two characters in the book.

4.Obtaining the minimum spanning tree for the graph.
