# Character-Interaction-Networks-for-George-R.-R.-Martin-s-A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire-saga

This repo contains code for the following ones:
1.Visualize the data as a graph (use any in-built function).
2.Identify the most important character. Importance is defined based on the degree of the node.
3.Find out the shortest path between the characters Addam-Marbrand and Ysilla. The shortest path is used to identify the closeness of two characters in the book.
4.Obtain the minimum spanning tree for the graph.
